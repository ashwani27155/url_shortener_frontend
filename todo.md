In this Application I have store expire time as well
The expire this is 15 Days from the Date of creation of short link

My assumption is that,

We can take expire time from the user, means it's totally depend upon user.
But I have fix the expires time to 15 Days because in future we can add a user profile button where user can update their profile
And from there we can give an option to update the expire date.

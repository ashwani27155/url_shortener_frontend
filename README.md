For Backend:-

I have choose MVC(Model-View-Controller) Architecture, The reason behind choosing this architecture, because MVC architecture is a popular design pattern for building robust and scalable backend systems.

In MVC,

Model: It represent the Database Schema and business logic of the application. Basically it manages data, logic, and rules of the application.
View: View layer is responsible for rendering the data from the model in a user-friendly format.
Controller: Controller layer works as an intermediary between the Model and View. It handles user input, processes it with the model, and returns the output display.

But for backend there is no view layer,

In backend all the business logic are goes inside controller folder,
All the database related stubs are goes inside Model folder like database schema,
Inside routes folder we define API routes by using this routes we can access any particular API for performing the action.

For Frontend:-

For Frontend development i have use React Js, and for styling i have used Material UI, I have choose react becase React is very popular technology for building frontend.
